# ODA Canvas - use-case library

This use-case library defines the interactions between a generic **ODA Component** and the **ODA Canvas**. The ODA Canvas provides access to a range of common services (for identity management, authentication, observability etc) and has a set of **Software Operators** that automatically configure these services based on requirements defined in the ODA Component YAML specification. 

Software Operators are a key concept in the ODA Canvas. For more information, see the 2016 CoreOS blog post that introduced the concept: [Introducing Operators: Putting Operational Knowledge into Software](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129131616/https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html). There is a good definition of software operators at: [operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator](https://operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator).

The ODA canvas is itself a modular and extensible platform. The list below shows the operators that appear in the Canvas use-case inventory. The ODA-Component Accelerator is building a reference implementation of an ODA Canvas with a range of operators that are open-source and freely available for organizations to re-use, extend or replace with their own implementations. We expect a typical production implementation will use a combination of standard operators and custom operators that can implement that organizations specific operational policies.

## ODA Software Operators

This is a list of the Canvas operators (including status of whether this has been tested in the Canvas referernce implementation).

| Operator             | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Component Lifecycle Management | The Component Lifecycle Management operator manages the de-composition of an ODA component into APIs, Events and other resources (that are processed by their corresponding operators). |
| API Management       | Configures the API Gateway and/or Service Mesh to provide security, throttling and other non-functional services to allow API endpoints to be exposed |
| Event Management     | Configures event based integration to allow components to use asynchronous events (in addition to Rest based API integration). |
| Identity Config  | Configures an Identity Management Service based on requirements defined in ODA Components. |
| Observability Config | Configures observabiliy services for both technical and business metrics and events. Enables alarming, tracing and root-cause analysis of issues.|
| Secrets Management   | Configures a secrets vault to enable ODA Components to store secrets in a secure way |
| Carbon Control    | Configures a services to analyze carbon (and energy) usage of ODA Components and to provide API services to enable components to make intelligent decisions to minimise Carbon usage.  |
| Cost Control      | Configures services for cost control for both cloud consumption and license costs.  |
| Other                | Additional operators will be added over time.  |
