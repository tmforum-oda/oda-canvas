group Bootstrap
IdentityResource <- ComponentOperator : create

IdentityResource -> identityOperator: on.create 
identityOperator -> IDM: Create client for component
note right
    Clients are entities that can request authentication of a user.
    All the roles and permissions are associated with a client.
end note

ComponentImplementation -> SecretStore: Read ClientID and secret
note right
    Populating the ClientID and secret from the identity platform is
    out of scope for the Canvas, but the Reference Implementation uses
    a credentials operator to simulate this.
end note

identityOperator -> IdentityResource : Query bootstrap Admin role defined\nin component SecurityFunction segment
identityOperator -> IDM: Assign Canvas **canvassystem** client to Admin role
note right
    The Admin role is used by the Canvas to call APIs on the ODA Component.
end note

group Dynamic role management - optional
    identityOperator -> ComponentImplementation: Register identityOperator to listen to the\nAPI provided by the component
    note right
        The component implementation provides an API that the identityOperator can call to manage roles.
        The identityOperator listens to the API and manages roles based on the events. The component needs
        to implement the **TMF672 User Roles and Permissions API** and the operator listens for **permissionSpecificationSet** events.
    end note
    identityOperator -> ComponentImplementation: Query dynamically defined roles in\nAPI provided by the component
    identityOperator -> IDM: create role(s)
end

    identityOperator -> IdentityResource: Query statically defined roles in\ncomponent SecurityFunction segment
