# Canvas Log Viewer utility

This is a simple kubectl utility to display log information on the ODA Canvas for a Component.

# Installation

```
npm install @lesterthomas/kubectl-canvas_logs -g
```


Then, to run plugin within kubectl:

```
kubectl canvas-logs [component name] [component operator pod name]
```
(in a future release, it should automatically find the component operator pod name, but for now, you can find it using `kubectl get pods --selector app=oda-controller -n canvas`)

The utility will use the current kubeconfig to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. You should get a screen like the one below:

To exit the utility, type `CTRL-C`
