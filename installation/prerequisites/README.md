# Prerequisites installation

This contains instructions for installing the underlying services that the Canvas manages. This reference implementation contains open-source implementations of these services - a production Canvas may choose to implement alternatives. As long as the alternatives support the same open standards then the Canvas will be able to manage and configure them.

## Observability

The first prerequisite is for Observability. The [open-source-observability](/charts/observability-stack) folder contains a chart of commonly used open-source systems for observing open-metrics and open-telemetry data. Execute this as a pre-requisite to use these open-source components.
