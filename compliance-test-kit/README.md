# ODA Canvas Use-Case library, BDD and TDD

The compliance test kit for an ODA Canvas consists of:

* [BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) features and scenarios](BDD-and-TDD/README.md) that describe every interaction in each use-case using examples. The use-case library is at: [usecase-library](../usecase-library/README.md).
* TDD (Test-Driven Development) that defines tests for each BDD scenario (embedded within each BDD).

This is *WORK IN PROGRESS* and will eventually form the compliance test kit for an ODA Canvas implementation. The original MVP canvas CTK is referenced below.
