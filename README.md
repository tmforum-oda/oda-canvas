# Open Digital Architecture Canvas

The Open Digital Architecture (ODA) Canvas is an execution environment for ODA Components and the release automation part of a CI/CD pipeline. This repository contains the Reference Implementation, open-source code, use-cases and compliance-test-kit for a [TMForum ODA canvas](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/deployment-runtime/oda-canvas/). 


You are free to use this as a starting point for your own ODA Canvas implementation. The [Usecase Library](usecase-library/README.md) shows how ODA Components interact with the ODA Canvas. The [Compliance Test Kit](compliance-test-kit/README.md) details the features required to be a fully compliant ODA Canvas and a set of compliance tests that can be used to validate any ODA Canvas. The [source code](source/README.md) contains the source code for the operators that are part of the ODA Canvas.

The Reference Implementation of the ODA Canvas will be used for ODA Component certification.
