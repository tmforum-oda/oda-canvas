Feature: UC003-F004 Expose APIs: Upgrade component with additional ExposedAPI

    Background:
        Given an example package 'productcatalog-v1' with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1' package
        And the 'ctk-productcatalogmanagement' component has a deployment status of 'Complete'
     
    Scenario: Upgrade component with additional ExposedAPI in coreFunction
        Given an example package 'productcatalog-enhanced-v1' with '2' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I upgrade the 'productcatalog-enhanced-v1' package
        And the 'ctk-productcatalogmanagement' component has a deployment status of 'Complete'
        Then I should see the 'promotionmanagement' ExposedAPI resource on the 'ctk-productcatalogmanagement' component
