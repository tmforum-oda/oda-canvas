Feature: UC002-F002 Upgrade Component

    Scenario Outline: Updated component with added ExposedAPI resources
        Given A baseline 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package installed as release 'pc'
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-enhanced-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '2' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I upgrade the 'productcatalog-enhanced-v1beta3' package as release 'pc'
        Then I should see the 'promotionmanagement' ExposedAPI resource on the 'productcatalogmanagement' component

    Scenario Outline: Updated component with removed ExposedAPI resources
        Given A baseline 'productcatalog-enhanced-v1beta3' package installed as release 'pc'
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I upgrade the 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package as release 'pc'
        Then I should not see the 'promotionmanagement' ExposedAPI resource on the 'productcatalogmanagement' component

    Scenario Outline: Updated component with updated ExposedAPI resources
        Given A baseline 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package installed as release 'pc'
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-updated-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I upgrade the 'productcatalog-updated-v1beta3' package as release 'pc'
