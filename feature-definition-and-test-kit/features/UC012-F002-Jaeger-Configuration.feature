Feature: UC012-F002 - Verify Jaeger Tracing Configuration

  As a platform operator
  I want to verify that Jaeger tracing components are properly deployed and configured
  So that I can ensure distributed tracing is available for authentication logging and system observability

  Background:
    # Given the observability stack is installed

  # Scenario: Verify Jaeger components are properly deployed
    # When I check the Jaeger deployment status
    # Then the Jaeger query service should be running in the "monitoring" namespace
    # And the Jaeger collector service should be running in the "monitoring" namespace
    # And the Jaeger query UI should be accessible on port 16686

  # Scenario: Verify Jaeger services have correct endpoints
    # Given the Jaeger services are running
    # When I check the Jaeger service endpoints
    # Then the Jaeger collector should be accessible on port 4317
    # And the Jaeger query should be accessible on port 16686
    # And the Jaeger collector should accept OTLP traces

  # Scenario: Verify Jaeger storage configuration
    # Given the Jaeger services are running
    # When I check the Jaeger storage configuration
    # Then Jaeger should be configured with memory storage
    # And the storage should support trace retention for at least 50000 traces
