Feature: UC003-F003 Expose APIs: Verify API implementation is ready

    Scenario: Verify ExposedAPI Resource is ready for Core ExposedAPI
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package
        Then I should see the 'productcatalogmanagement' ExposedAPI resource on the 'productcatalogmanagement' component with an implementation ready status on the Service Mesh or Gateway

    Scenario: Verify ExposedAPI Resource is ready for Management ExposedAPI
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'managementFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package
        Then I should see the 'metrics' ExposedAPI resource on the 'productcatalogmanagement' component with an implementation ready status on the Service Mesh or Gateway

    Scenario: Verify ExposedAPI Resource is ready for Security ExposedAPI
        Given An example package 'productcatalog-v1beta3' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'securityFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1beta3' package
        Then I should see the 'partyrole' ExposedAPI resource on the 'productcatalogmanagement' component with an implementation ready status on the Service Mesh or Gateway
