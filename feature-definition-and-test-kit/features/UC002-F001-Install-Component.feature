Feature: UC002-F001 Install Component

    Scenario Outline: Create ExposedAPI resources for each segment
        Given an example package '<PackageName>' with '<ExposedApiCount>' ExposedAPI in its '<SegmentName>' segment
        When I install the '<PackageName>' package as release '<ReleaseName>'
        And the '<ComponentName>' component has a deployment status of 'Complete'
        Then I should see the '<ExposedAPIName>' ExposedAPI resource on the '<ComponentName>' component

    Examples:
    | Name           | PackageName       | ReleaseName  | ExposedAPIName           | ComponentName                | SegmentName        | ExposedApiCount |
    | Core API       | productcatalog-v1 |      ctk     | productcatalogmanagement | ctk-productcatalogmanagement | coreFunction       | 1               |
    | Management API | productcatalog-v1 |      ctk     | metrics                  | ctk-productcatalogmanagement | managementFunction | 1               |
    | Security API   | productcatalog-v1 |      ctk     | partyrole                | ctk-productcatalogmanagement | securityFunction   | 1               |

    Scenario Outline: Create DependentAPI resources for each segment
        Given an example package '<PackageName>' with '<DependentApiCount>' DependentAPI in its '<SegmentName>' segment
        When I install the '<PackageName>' package as release '<ReleaseName>'
        Then I should see the '<DependentAPIName>' DependentAPI resource on the '<ComponentName>' component

    Examples:
    | Name           | PackageName                         | ReleaseName | DependentAPIName         | ComponentName                | SegmentName        | DependentApiCount |
    | Core API       | productcatalog-dependendent-API-v1  |      ctk    | downstreamproductcatalog | ctk-productcatalogmanagement | coreFunction       | 1                 |
