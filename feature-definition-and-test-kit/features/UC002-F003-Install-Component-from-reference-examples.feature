Feature: UC002-F003 Install Component from Repository

    Scenario Outline: Install a component and verify ExposedAPI resources creation
        Given the repository '<RepoName>' with URL '<ReferenceExampleRepoURL>' is added and updated
        When I install the '<PackageName>' package as release '<ReleaseName>' from the '<RepoName>' repository 
        And the '<ComponentName>' component has a deployment status of 'Complete' for the '<ReleaseName>' release
        Then I should see the '<ExposedAPIName>' ExposedAPI resource on the '<ComponentName>' component

    Examples:
    | RepoName       | ReferenceExampleRepoURL                                         | PackageName       | ReleaseName  |  ComponentName            |  ExposedAPIName             |
