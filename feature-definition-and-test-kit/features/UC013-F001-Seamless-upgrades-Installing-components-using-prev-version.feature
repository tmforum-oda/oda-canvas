Feature: UC013-F001 Seamless upgrade: Installing component using previous version

    Scenario: Installing a component using a previous (N-1) version
        Given an example package 'productcatalog-v1beta2' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1beta2' package
        Then I can query the 'v1beta3' spec version of the 'productcatalogmanagement' component

    Scenario: Installing a component using a previous (N-2) version
        Given an example package 'productcatalog-v1beta1' with a 'productcatalogmanagement' component with '1' ExposedAPI in its 'coreFunction' segment
        When I install the 'productcatalog-v1beta1' package
        Then I can query the 'v1beta3' spec version of the 'productcatalogmanagement' component
