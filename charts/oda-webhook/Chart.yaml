description: A Helm chart to deploy the webhook following pattern in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.1.2
# version: 1.1.2 - bug fix to update apitype to apiType for conversions to v1beta3
# version: 1.1.1 - bug fix for empty specification property of exposedAPI
# version: 1.1.0 - changed the specification field in the exposed API to an array for v1beta3
# version: 1.0.0 - baseline version

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. We are versioning the canvas as the
# version of the latest component spec that it supports.
appVersion: "v1beta3"
