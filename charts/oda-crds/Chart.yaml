description: A helm chart to deploy the Canvas CRDs

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.1.4
# version: 1.1.4 - added componentMetadata and apiSDO to v1beta4 crds
# version: 1.1.3 - added v1beta4 crds 
# version: 1.1.2 - updated components crds

# version: 1.1.0 - changed the specification field in the exposed API to an array
