# Observability design

This document describes the design artefacts for the Observability part of the [overall ODA Canvas design](Canvas-design.md).

## Use cases

The observability use cases are documented in the [use case library](usecase-library/README.md) as follows:

* [UC004-Configure-Observability](usecase-library/UC004-Configure-Observability.md)
* [UC005-Technical-Observability](usecase-library/UC005-Technical-Observability.md)
* [UC006-Business-Observability](usecase-library/UC006-Business-Observability.md)
* [UC011-License-Metrics-Observability](usecase-library/UC011-License-Metrics-Observability.md)


## BDD Features (WIP)

For each use case, a set of BDD features describes the behaviour required of the Canvas, using scenarios. The goal is for a set of business-friendly pseudo-code that describes the behaviour of the Canvas, and that directly maps to compliance tests (TDD) that will test that feature. Some features are optional - the compliance report will indicate which features have passed, but will not fail the compliance test for a canvas if an optional feature is not implemented.
